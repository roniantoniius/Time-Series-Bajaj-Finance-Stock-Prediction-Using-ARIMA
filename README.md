### Business Understanding 😇 
This project I am interested in exploring BajFinance stock price prediction using data from 2000 to 2020. As we know, stock price is very valuable information in the financial world 💰💼. As a data scientist, I want to help investors and market analysts to forecast BajFinance's future stock price behavior.

Using machine learning techniques, I will create a model to predict stock price movements. This will provide valuable insights to investors in their investment decision making. We will utilize BajFinance's historical stock price dataset to train our model.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide accurate predictions of BajFinance's stock price in the future, so that investors can make better investment decisions. Whats good Letsgo! 💪📈'
